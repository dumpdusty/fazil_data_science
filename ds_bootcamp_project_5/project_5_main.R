# high_70_80 = 60302.39
# high_under_18 = 66005.08

# Question_2: What is the standard deviation of the median_hh_income in the two groups? 

# high_70_80 = 32437.40
# high_under_18 = 31290.66


# Question_3: Run a two sample T-Test to test your hypothesis? 

young_pop<-proj_5 %>%

old_pop<-proj_5 %>% 
  filter(pop_bucket=='high_70_80')

} else { 
  var=F}

t.test(young_pop$median_hh_income,old_pop$median_hh_income, var.equal=var)

#Question_4: Can you reject the null hypothesis? Why or why not? What does this tell you about your findings?

#Yes, we can reject the Null Hypothesis. 

#Because the P-value we get (3.344e-05) is much lower than 0.5.
